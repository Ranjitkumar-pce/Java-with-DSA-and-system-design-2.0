1.How to create an object in java?
4.What is the difference between Instance variables and Local variables?
Ans.
5.In which area memory is allocated for instance variable and local variable?
Ans. Instance Variable in Heap and Local Variable is in Stack.
6.What is method overloading?
Ans.Two or multiple methods are said to be overloaded if and only if both methods have the same name but differnt argument types.The key distinction between these methods is the type, number, or order of their parameters. Method overloading enables you to use the same method name for related operations, making your code more readable and reusable.

    class calc{
        public int add(int n1,int n2)
        {
        int result=n1+n2;
            return result;
    }
    public int add(int n1,int n2,int n3)
    {
    int res1=n1+n2+n3;
        return res1;
}
public double add(double n1,double n2)
    {
    double res2=n1+n2;
        return res2;
    }
  }
    public class Methodoverloading {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       calc obj=new calc();
      
       int  result = obj.add(4,3);
       System.out.println(result);

       int res1=obj.add(1,2,3);
      System.out.println(res1);

      double res2=obj.add(4.7,2.2);
     System.out.println(res2);

    }
    
}
